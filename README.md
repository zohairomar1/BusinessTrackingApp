# Purchases Tracker

## *A java program that helps retailers with tracking and analysing customer purchases*

<p> My application allows a retail business to enter information regarding customer purchases based on receipts. I plan to add features that help retail businesses view and analyse their business operations. My application will offer features such as the ability to view the total money spent in a specific time period, track the amount of goods purchased in a specific time period etc.

<p> This project is of interest to me because I am very interested in general business operations and optimization. Also, I plan to transfer into the Business and Computer Science combined major, so I think this project matches my field of study and interests very well.
