# Purchases Tracker

## *A java program that helps retailers with tracking and analysing customer purchases*

<p> My application allows a retail business to enter customer purchases and information based on receipts. I plan to add features that help retail businesses view and analyse their business operations. My application will offer features such as the ability to view the total money spent, track the amount of goods purchased, set a revenue goal and view progress etc.

<p> This project is of interest to me because I am very interested in general business operations and optimization. Also, I plan to transfer into the Business and Computer Science combined major, so I think this project matches my field of study and interests very well.
